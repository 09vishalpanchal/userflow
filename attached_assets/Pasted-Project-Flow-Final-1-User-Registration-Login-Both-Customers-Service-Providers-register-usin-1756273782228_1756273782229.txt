Project Flow (Final) 1. User Registration & Login • Both Customers & Service Providers register using phone number + OTP verification (via SMS gateway or Firebase). • After login → users must complete their profile: o Customer Profile → Name, Email, Location (auto-detected using Google Maps API, editable). o Service Provider Profile → Name, Email, Location (Google Maps API), Business details, Upload Documents (like license, ID proof, GST if applicable) → sent for Admin Approval. ________________________________________ 2. Customer Flow 1. Post Requirement / Job o Select category (e.g., Plumber, Electrician, Carpenter). o Add description (details of requirement). o Location auto-filled (Google Maps API), editable by customer. 2. Job Submission o Requirement saved in system. o Trigger instant notifications to nearby approved service providers (within set radius). o Notifications go via:  App push notification.  WhatsApp Business API message. 3. Customer waits for providers to unlock their contact. ________________________________________ 3. Service Provider Flow 1. After Admin Approval → provider can: o View job listings in chosen radius (default: 5km, expandable up to 20km). o Radius can be increased/decreased anytime for better lead visibility. 2. Unlock Contact o To see customer details, provider must unlock using wallet balance. o Unlock fee is deducted automatically from wallet. o Only first 3 providers can unlock → ensures limited competition. o Once unlocked, provider can directly contact customer via phone/WhatsApp. ________________________________________ 4. Wallet System (Service Provider Only) • Providers maintain a wallet balance. • Recharge wallet via online payment gateway (Razorpay, Stripe, etc.). • Unlocking a job deducts admin-defined price (e.g., ₹100 per unlock). • Transaction logs: o Recharge history. o Deduction history. o Current balance. • If balance < unlock price → provider gets low balance notification + recharge reminder. ________________________________________ 5. Admin Flow Admin manages platform: • User Management o Approve/reject service provider documents. o Block/unblock customers or providers. o If customer blocked → jobs hidden from providers. o If provider blocked → jobs not visible, can’t unlock contacts. • Job Management o View/manage all job posts. o Remove spam/inappropriate requirements. • Wallet & Pricing o Set unlock price (e.g., ₹X per requirement). o Monitor provider wallet balances & transaction logs. ________________________________________ 6. Notifications System • New Job Posted → Notifications to all providers within radius (App + WhatsApp). • Low Wallet Balance → Recharge reminder notification to providers. • Unlock Success → Notify provider with customer contact details. • Admin Updates (approval/rejection/blocking) → Notify via app + WhatsApp/email. ________________________________________ 7. Extra Features • Radius Filter → Provider can adjust radius anytime (5–20km). • Google Maps API → Used for location selection, distance-based job filtering. • WhatsApp Business API → Real-time notifications, direct customer engagement. • 3 Unlock Limit System → Only first 3 providers get customer details → ensures exclusivity.
